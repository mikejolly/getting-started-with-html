  World Wide Web - collection of HTML documents.<br><br>

http - protocol that browser uses to communicate with Servers<br><br>

<b>HTML</b> - hyper text markup language<br>
text - what you see<br>
markup - what it looks like<br>
references - to other docs - videos, images, etc<br>
links - to other pages<br><br>

<b>Markup</b><br>
less than, b, greater than = opening tag<br>
less than, slash, b, greater than = closing tag<br>     ——Element (both opening and closing, plus all inside)<br><br>

<b>Attributes</b><br>
these notes were all in HTML code, so they render, making their use moot!<br><br>

<b>Image Tag</b><br>
img src=“url where image is” alt=“text displayed when the image doesn’t load”>
Images do not have a closing tag<br><br>

<b>Whitespace</b><br>
less than, br, greater than = break (no closing tag (aka void tag)). Inline. Simply ends a line.<br>
less than, p, greater than = paragraph (NOT a void tag, i.e. needs a closing tag. 
Block. Makes an invisible box around the text, has height, width, etc.<br><br>

Span (inline)<br>
Div (block) - these two relate to how text is laid out (CSS)<br><br>

HTML Document<br>
Think of the source code on a basic webpage
Doctype, head, title, body,
